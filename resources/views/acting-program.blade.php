                    The Acting program at Triple Threat; led and taught by Aidan J. Lawrence, allows young artists to explore text and stories through scene work. Aidan uses his fourteen years of training, professional Experience, (as seen on HBO, NETFLIX, OFF-BROADWAY) and energy to create professional quality work out of his students. Aidan danced at triple threat for eight years before starting the acting program and becoming a choreographer at the studio. He uses his education and experience with movement to help embody text and storytelling to create a well rounded and diverse performer. In class, all different styles of scenes are explored, (comedy’s, drama’s, sit-com, theatre, horror,) students are given ample rehearsal time and feedback in class before coming back in to film their scenes with professional equipment and a crew. This gives students an authentic on-set experience. Students develop tools used professionally, artistically, and personally that they take with them into college and beyond. Under Aidan’s coaching, students have gone on to earn acceptances from LaGuardia, Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, Edward R. Murrow high school, and other successfully run shows! Aidan’s look is to cultivate emerging performers for a new generation in the arts.
