                                    In 2012, Dana decided it was time to open Triple Threat Performing Arts Company alongside her two sisters, Lynda and Kim Senisi.

                                    Dana is constantly inspired by her students. She has two little dancers herself now and is enjoying being a dance mom, too! She takes pride in what she does and will continue to provide love and dance to future generations. Dana believes that everyone should have the opportunity to dance. Given the right training, love, and patience … everything is possible.
